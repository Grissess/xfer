_A file transfer service_

This was my memory of an old, neat way to transfer files forever ago (at least
ten years) that I shamelessly copied incorrectly back then. This is a more
faithful iteration of a "zero store" file transfer service implemented over
HTTP, such that the HTTP server merely proxies one upload to one download.
Because of this, it should be relatively straightforward to host.
